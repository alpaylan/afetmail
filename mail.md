Dear School Official,

I hope this email finds you well.

As you may have heard, a devastating earthquake hit Turkey and Syria on February 6, 2023. The earthquake has caused immense damage, leaving at least 25,000 people dead and many more injured or homeless.

I believe that it is our duty to support those affected by this tragedy.

Firstly, I would like to request our school to inform of all the ways in which we can help the victims of this earthquake. Below, I am adding a link that describes possible methods of donation.

Secondly, I would like to request that our school create a donation-matching campaign up to a given amount. I believe that this would be a great way to encourage our students to donate to the cause. This method is very effective and has been used by many other organizations in the past.

Thank you for taking the time to read my request. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter.

Best regards,
